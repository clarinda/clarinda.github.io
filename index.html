			<h2>Bio</h2>

			<p>I am a senior at Eastern Washington University studying Technical Communication with minors in Linguistics and Visual Communication &amp; Design. My intent upon graduation is to enter the field of editing and publication with my sights set on young adult fiction. To this end, I have focused my studies on editing, design, and grammar. I have an intense passion for grammar and can spot a comma splice from fifty paces.</p>
